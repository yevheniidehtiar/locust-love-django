# Tasks to Extend Performance Cases Portfolio

## Introduction
This document outlines tasks to extend the performance cases portfolio for the Locust Love Django project. The goal is to add more examples of common Django performance issues and their solutions to help developers identify and fix performance problems in their applications.

## Current Coverage
The project currently demonstrates the following performance issues:
1. N+1 query problem (`/api/examples/n-plus-one/`)
2. Optimized queries using `select_related` (`/api/examples/optimized/`)
3. Expensive queries with nested loops (`/api/examples/expensive/`)

## Tasks by Category

### 1. Database Query Optimization

#### High Priority
1. **Implement Prefetch Related Example**
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates the use of `prefetch_related` for many-to-many or reverse foreign key relationships
   - Compare with a non-optimized version to show performance difference
   - Complexity: Medium

2. **Implement Bulk Create/Update Example**
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates the performance benefits of using `bulk_create` and `bulk_update` instead of individual save operations
   - Complexity: Medium

3. **Implement Query Annotation Example** [DONE]
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates using annotations to perform calculations in the database rather than in Python
   - Complexity: Medium

#### Medium Priority
4. **Implement Database Index Example** [DONE]
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates the performance impact of adding indexes to frequently queried fields
   - Include before/after measurements
   - Complexity: Medium

5. **Implement Raw SQL Example** [DONE]
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates when using raw SQL might be more efficient than the ORM
   - Compare with equivalent ORM query
   - Complexity: Hard

6. **Implement Query Caching Example** [DONE]
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates caching query results to avoid repeated database hits
   - Complexity: Medium

### 2. Template and View Optimization

#### High Priority
7. **Implement Template Fragment Caching Example**
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates caching expensive template fragments
   - Complexity: Medium

8. **Implement Deferred Loading Example**
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates using `defer()` and `only()` to load only necessary fields
   - Complexity: Easy

#### Medium Priority
9. **Implement Pagination Example**
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates proper pagination for large datasets
   - Compare with loading all data at once
   - Complexity: Easy

10. **Implement Serializer Optimization Example**
    - Create an endpoint that demonstrates optimizing DRF serializers for better performance
    - Complexity: Medium

### 3. Middleware and Request Processing

#### High Priority
11. **Implement Middleware Overhead Example**
    - Create an example that demonstrates the performance impact of middleware
    - Show how to optimize middleware execution
    - Complexity: Hard

12. **Implement Request Caching Example**
    - Create an endpoint that demonstrates caching entire responses
    - Complexity: Medium

#### Medium Priority
13. **Implement Conditional Processing Example**
    - Create an endpoint that demonstrates using HTTP conditional processing (ETag, If-Modified-Since)
    - Complexity: Hard

### 4. Asynchronous Processing

#### High Priority
14. **Implement Background Task Example**
    - Create an endpoint that demonstrates offloading heavy processing to background tasks
    - Complexity: Hard

#### Medium Priority
15. **Implement Streaming Response Example**
    - Create an endpoint that demonstrates using streaming responses for large data sets
    - Complexity: Medium

### 5. Memory Usage Optimization

#### Medium Priority
16. **Implement Memory Profiling Example**
    - Create an endpoint that demonstrates memory-intensive operations and how to optimize them
    - Complexity: Hard

17. **Implement Iterator Usage Example**
    - Create an endpoint that demonstrates using iterators instead of loading all data into memory
    - Complexity: Medium

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (High Priority Tasks)
- Tasks 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14

### Phase 2 (Medium Priority Tasks)
- Tasks 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 15

### Phase 3 (Remaining Tasks)
- Tasks 16, 17

## Expected Outcomes
Implementing these tasks will:
1. Provide a more comprehensive set of performance examples
2. Help developers identify and fix common performance issues
3. Demonstrate best practices for Django application performance
4. Create a valuable educational resource for the Django community

## Metrics for Success
- Each example should clearly demonstrate the performance issue
- Each example should include a solution that measurably improves performance
- Locust tests should be able to detect and report on each performance issue
- Documentation should explain each issue and solution clearly
