# Tasks to Extend Performance Cases Portfolio

## Introduction
This document outlines tasks to extend the performance cases portfolio for the Locust Love Django project. The goal is to add more examples of common Django performance issues and their solutions to help developers identify and fix performance problems in their applications.

## Current Coverage
The project currently demonstrates the following performance issues:
1. N+1 query problem (`/api/examples/n-plus-one/`)
2. Optimized queries using `select_related` (`/api/examples/optimized/`)
3. Expensive queries with nested loops (`/api/examples/expensive/`)

## Tasks by Category

### 1. Database Query Optimization

#### High Priority
1. **Implement Prefetch Related Example**
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates the use of `prefetch_related` for many-to-many or reverse foreign key relationships
   - Compare with a non-optimized version to show performance difference
   - Complexity: Medium

2. **Implement Bulk Create/Update Example**
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates the performance benefits of using `bulk_create` and `bulk_update` instead of individual save operations
   - Complexity: Medium

3. **Implement Query Annotation Example** [DONE]
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates using annotations to perform calculations in the database rather than in Python
   - Complexity: Medium

#### Medium Priority
4. **Implement Database Index Example** [DONE]
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates the performance impact of adding indexes to frequently queried fields
   - Include before/after measurements
   - Complexity: Medium

5. **Implement Raw SQL Example** [DONE]
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates when using raw SQL might be more efficient than the ORM
   - Compare with equivalent ORM query
   - Complexity: Hard

6. **Implement Query Caching Example** [DONE]
   - Create an endpoint that demonstrates caching query results to avoid repeated database hits
   - Complexity: Medium

### 2. N+1 Query Detection and Prevention

#### High Priority
7. **Implement Admin List Views with N+1 Queries** [DONE]
   - Create admin list views where joined columns trigger N+1 queries
   - Demonstrate how to fix with `select_related` and `prefetch_related`
   - Complexity: Medium

8. **Implement Admin List View with Large Blob Fields** [DONE]
   - Create an admin list view with a model containing a large binary field (2MB)
   - Show performance impact of loading these fields in list views
   - Demonstrate how to optimize with `defer()` or custom admin methods
   - Complexity: Medium

9. **Implement Complex Nested Functions with N+1 Queries** [DONE]
   - Create a job with complicated nested functions that use model objects
   - Functions should access related models in ways that trigger N+1 queries
   - Make the N+1 issues hard to detect during code review
   - Complexity: Hard

10. **Implement Department Performance Analysis with Hidden N+1 Queries** [DONE]
    - Create a complex business logic function that analyzes department performance
    - Include multiple levels of nested function calls that obscure database access patterns
    - Demonstrate how tools can detect these issues even when they're hard for humans to spot
    - Complexity: Hard




## Implementation Plan


## Expected Outcomes
Implementing these tasks will:
1. Provide a more comprehensive set of performance examples
2. Help developers identify and fix common performance issues
3. Demonstrate best practices for Django application performance
4. Create a valuable educational resource for the Django community

## Metrics for Success
- Each example should clearly demonstrate the performance issue
- Each example should include a solution that measurably improves performance
- Locust tests should be able to detect and report on each performance issue
- Documentation should explain each issue and solution clearly
